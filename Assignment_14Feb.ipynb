    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python. \n",
    "A1. Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently. In a simple, single-core CPU, it is achieved using frequent switching between threads. This is termed context switching. In context switching, the state of a thread is saved and the state of another thread is loaded whenever any interrupt (due to I/O or manually set) takes place. Context switching takes place so frequently that all the threads appear to be running parallelly. In Python, the threading module provides a very simple and intuitive API for spawning multiple threads in a program. "

    "1. run():The Thread.run() method is an inbuilt method of the Thread class of the threading module , it is used to represent a thread's activity. It calls the method expressed as the target argument in the Thread object along with the positional and keyword arguments taken from the args and kwargs arguments, respectively. This method can also be overridden in the subclass.\n",
    "2. start(): The Thread.start() method is an inbuilt method of the Thread class of the threading module, it is used to start a thread's activity. This method calls the run() method internally which then executes the target method. This method must be called at most one time for one thread. If it is called more than once, it raises a RuntimeError.\n",

Whenever this method is called for any Thread object, it blocks the calling thread till the time the thread whose join() method is called terminates, either normally or through an unhandled exception.\n",
    "4. isAlive(): Return whether the thread is alive. This method returns True just before the run() method starts until just after the run() method terminates. The module function enumerate() returns a list of all alive threads."

    "A5. ADVANTAGES:\n",
    "1. Improved performance: Multithreading can help increase the overall performance of an application, especially on systems with multiple processors or cores. It allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, utilizing the available CPU resources more efficiently.\n",
    "2. Responsiveness: In a single-threaded environment, if a long-running task blocks the main thread, the entire application becomes unresponsive. Multithreading can prevent this issue by running such tasks in separate threads, ensuring the application remains responsive.\n",
    "3. Better resource utilization: Multithreading allows better utilization of system resources by keeping the CPU busy while waiting for I/O operations or other tasks to complete.\n",
    "4. Simplified modeling: Some problems can be more naturally modeled using multiple threads. This makes the program easier to design, understand, and maintain.\n",
    "5. Parallelism: Multithreading enables parallelism, which can lead to significant performance improvements in applications that can be divided into smaller, independent tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "DISADVANTAGES:\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreading adds complexity to the program, making it more difficult to design, implement, and debug. Developers need to be aware of synchronization, deadlocks, race conditions, and other concurrency-related issues.\n",
    "2. Synchronization overhead: To avoid data corruption and maintain consistency, developers must synchronize access to shared resources, which can result in additional overhead and reduced performance.\n",
    "3. Context switching: Context switching between threads consumes CPU time and resources, which can lead to performance degradation if not managed efficiently.\n",
    "4. Hard to predict behavior: Due to the concurrent nature of multithreading, the behavior of the program can be hard to predict and reproduce, especially when it comes to debugging.\n",
    "5. Limited by hardware: The performance benefits of multithreading are limited by the number of available cores or processors in the system. In some cases, excessive use of threads can lead to performance degradation instead of improvement."
